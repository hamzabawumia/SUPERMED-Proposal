NHIS will STOP taking paper claims by the year 2022. 
You are the Medical Sup. or Administrator at your hospital 
What strategic steps are you taking in preparation for E-claims ? 

Yes, there are many Hospital Software Solutions on the market but please shine your eyes and get a good one.
I have seen the headaches that some hospitals have gone through because they did not listen 
and bought a "bogus" software.
I even heard the Ghana Health Service was trying to select one from the market a few years ago.
The problem is that, those selling the "bogus" softwares are the ones with all the connections at the top.
Anyway, I don't know where they ended with that plan. LOL

Here is some advice; there are 3 top hospital software solutions in Ghana: SUPERMED, HAMS and J-MED.
They can all perform the needed core functions, however HAMS (the most expensive one) is less user friendly whilst SUPERMED (the most affordable one) is more user friendly. 
J-MED is somewhat in-between.

I must confess that I also struggled when i launched the first version of my software - SUPERMED.
I received my fair share of bashing from clients and other industry players but i kept improving. 
Now I have reached that point where SUPERMED commands great respect in the Hospital Software industry.
Even the big companies like HAMS and JMED know that SUPERMED is a force to reckon with.


So back to the question. 
What strategic steps are you taking in preparation for E-claims ? 
The clock is ticking and the change is inevitable.

For now, all i can say is that when the trumpet blows... Software prices will increase.
So it may be wiser to get a good ahead of time.
