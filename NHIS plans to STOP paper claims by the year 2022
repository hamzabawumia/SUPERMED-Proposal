NHIS will STOP taking paper claims by the year 2022. 
You are the Medical Sup. at your hospital 
What strategic steps are you taking in preparation for E-claims ? 

Yes, there are many Hospital Software Solutions on the market but please shine your eyes and get a good one.
I have seen the headaches that some hospitals have gone through just because they did not listen 
and bought the wrong software.

I must confess that I also struggled when i launched the first version of my software - SUPERMED.
I received my fair share of bashing from clients and other industry players but i kept improving. 
Now I have reached that point where SUPERMED commands great respect in the Hospital Software industry.
Even the big companies like HAMS and JMED know that SUPERMED is a force to reckon with.

Here is some advice; there are 3 top hospital software solutions in Ghana: SUPERMED, HAMS and JMED.
You can perform the needed core functions with all three, however HAMS (the most expensive one) will do it via the difficult way while SUPERMED (the most affordable one) will use the easy way, 
JMED is somewhat in-between.


So back to the question. 
What strategic steps are you taking in preparation for E-claims ? 
The clock is ticking and you have not called me.
Ayoooo.
All i will say is that when the trumpet blows... Software prices will increase.
