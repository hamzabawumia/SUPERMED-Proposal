NHIS will STOP taking paper claims by the year 2022. 
You are the Medical Sup. at your hospital 
What strategic steps are you taking in preparation for E-claims ? 

Yes, there are many Hospital Software Solutions on the market but please shine your eyes and get a good one.
I have seen the headaches that some hospitals are going through just because they did not listen 
and bought the wrong software.

I must confess that i also struggled when i launched the first version of my software SUPERMED.
I received my fair share of bashing from clients but i have kept improving. 
Now I have reached that point where SUPERMED commands great respect in the Hospital Software industry.
Even the big companies like HAMS and JMED know that SUPERMED is a force to reckon with.

Here is some advice in case you are planning to acquire a software for your hospital:
There are 3 top contenders: SUPERMED, HAMS and JMED
You can perform the needed core functions with all three, 
but HAMS will do it via the difficult way while SUPERMED will use the easy way, JMED is somewhat in between.
Of course i will be biased towards SUPERMED because i built it myself


Ayoooo.

All i can say is that when the trumpet blows... our prices will increase. Lol
